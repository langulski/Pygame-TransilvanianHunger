## Objective
This is my second Pygame, it took a lot of effort to code it. This is a personal project just to pratice and keep learning Python as my primary tool. You can Also check my first Python game   <a href="https://github.com/langulski/Jumper-pygame">here</a>.</br>

### Game based in games like 'Mario style' and Castlevania

## Game Instructions

<br>

### How to Play? 
the Objective of the game is explore the map and find the exit door flagged by a 'bonfire', during the level you will encounter enemies through the map <br>
so in order to keep progress you better attack or avoid them.<br>

### Let's play?
In order to start the game, you must copy the repository into your computer, then run the 'main.py' file. 
you can use the arrow keys to move the player and the SPACE bar to attack.

## Learning Process
### Theory applied
- [x] Programming logic in Python;<br>
- [x] Error Handling ;<br>
- [x] Every game has a while True loop, and many other loops that makes the game running;<br>
- [x] Sub-functions ;<br>
- [x] Python Best Practices; <br>
- [x] Classes to determine the objects of the game;<br>

### Challenges
- Collision detection;
- Structure game code logic;
- Fixing bugs;
- Remember the rules for work with global variables inside functions;

### New Learnings
- Working with classes and importing other programmings.
 
### Improvement
- this is a work in progress there is much to be done.
